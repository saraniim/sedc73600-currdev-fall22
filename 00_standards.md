### Lesson alignment
I use the Common Sense Media lesson about digital footprint. 
Learning Target: Analyze how digital footprints lead others to conclusions about you and how your online actions need to be guided to leave a positive footprint. 
#### Part I
We talk about what a digital footprint is, what it means. Then how do our actions guide perception? Who might be looking? Now? In the future? 
#### Part II 
Students are given a scenario where they are looking at social media profiles of 2 candidates for hosting a show. The winner must be chosen based on their application
and social media profiles. They then choose a candidate (or not). They must find evidence to support their choice. It also possible that NEITHER candidate is a good match and that the search for a host should continue. 
This prompts the students to look at the first standard in depth. 
#### Part III
This part I made an addition to the original lesson.
The students must then discuss what the candidates could have done differently. Here, they look at the second standard. How could the candidates have made better 
choices in what they posted? How could they have been more appropriate? More positive? more responsible? Why? 
#### Part IV
Exit Slip:
How do our actions affect our digital footorint? What proactive steps can we take to ensure that we have a positive digital footprint and experience?
