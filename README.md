## Required Texts:
There Is No Required Text For This Class. Readings Will Be Assigned From A Variety Of Sources Week To Week And Are Outlined In The Syllabus.

## Course Description:

This Course Will Prepare Candidates To Develop Materials Ranging From
Individual Lessons And Units To Full Courses To Sequences Of Courses
In Alignment With Emerging Local, State, And National Standards To
Educate Students In The Field Of Computer Science.

Attention Will Be Given To Creating Materials Appropriate For A
Diverse Population Of Learners.

Candidates Will Also Be Prepared To Develop Computer Science
Educational Materials That Relate To Other Fields Of Study Thus Giving
All Students A Meaningful Educational Experience Regardless Of Their
Ultimate Career Choice.

Teacher-Candidates Will Produce A Complete Curriculum For A New Class
Designed For A School Which The Candidate Is Familiar.
Teacher-Candidates Will Create A Sample Unit And Individual Lesson
Plan For This Curriculum.
